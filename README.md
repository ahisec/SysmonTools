# üîé Sysmon View

Sysmon View helps track and visualize Sysmon logs by logically grouping and correlating events.  
It uses executables, session GUIDs, event creation times, and more to re-arrange data into multiple **views**.

![Sysmon View](Assets/Images/SysmonView/1.png "Sysmon View")

### Getting Started

Export Sysmon events to XML using `WEVTUtil` and import them into Sysmon View:

```powershell
WEVTUtil query-events "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" /format:xml /e:sysmonview > eventlog.xml
```

- Data is stored in a SQLite database file (**SysmonViewDB**) alongside the executable.
- The DB can be reused or shared; rename it to preserve prior imports.
- The DB also supports direct queries via any SQLite management tool.

### Sysmon Views

- **Process View** ‚Äì summarizes run sessions (per process GUID) and shows correlated events in a timeline-like flow.
- **Map View** ‚Äì geo-locates network destinations (via [ipstack](https://ipstack.com)) and pivots into correlated events.
- **All Events View** ‚Äì full search through collected data, including standalone events (e.g., driver loads), supports grouping by machine, event type, or GUID.

Additional features:

- Double-click any event to access details (e.g., Process Creation, Event ID 1).
- VirusTotal API integration for hash/IP lookups (requires API key).
- Experimental Elasticsearch support for multi-machine imports.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Sysmon Shell

Sysmon Shell provides a GUI to manage and apply Sysmon XML configurations.

![Sysmon Shell](Assets/Images/SysmonView/8.png "Sysmon Shell")

Features:

- Load, edit, preview, and export Sysmon XML configuration files (all schemas supported).
- Apply configs directly via `Sysmon.exe -c` (requires elevation).
- Export Sysmon logs with options: export-only, export+clear, or export+backup.
- Descriptions of all event types included (sourced from [Sysinternals Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)).
- Bundled with community-created configuration templates.

![Sysmon Shell Templates](Assets/Images/SysmonView/9.png "Sysmon Shell Templates")

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Sysmon Shell does not validate include/exclude conflicts. Errors are displayed directly from Sysmon output when applying configs.

# üì¶ Sysmon Box

Sysmon Box is a lightweight utility to build a database of captured Sysmon and network traffic.

![Sysmon Box](Assets/Images/SysmonView/10.png "Sysmon Box")

### Example Usage

Run Sysmon Box (requires Sysmon + tshark installed and running):

```bash
SysmonBox -in Wi-Fi
```

Workflow:

1. Captures traffic using `tshark` on the selected interface.
2. On stop (`CTRL+C`), dumps packets and exports Sysmon logs for the session.
3. Builds/updates a SysmonViewDB database combining Sysmon logs and traffic.
4. Open the DB with Sysmon View for correlation.
